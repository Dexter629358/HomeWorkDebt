# Task

- Think about the structure of the Laptop class for the hardware store - highlight
  the fields and methods. Implement in `Java`.
- Create many laptops.
- Write a method that will ask the user for a filtering criterion (or criteria) and
  output laptops that meet the filter. Filtering criteria can be stored in Map. For
  example:

  ```plain
  Enter the number corresponding to the required criterion:
  1 - RAM
  2 - Operating system
  3 - Color
  ```
- Next, you need to request the minimum values for the specified criteria - you can
  also save the filtering parameters in `Map`.
- Sort laptops of their initial set and output passing by conditions.
