# Task 1

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a 
sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least 
one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single 
space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between 
two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. 
Do not include any extra spaces.

## Example

- `"the sky is blue"` -> `"blue is sky the"`
- `"  hello world  "` -> `"world hello"`
- `"a good   example"` -> `"example good a"`
