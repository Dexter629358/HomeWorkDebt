# Task 5

## The OOP task

Designing and creating a class describing a vector. Create a class that describes
a vector (in three-dimensional space).

It must have:

- Constructor with parameters in the form of a list of coordinates `x`, `y`, `z`.
- A method that calculates the length of a vector. The root can be calculated using
  Math.sqrt():
- A method that calculates the scalar product.
- A method that computes a vector product with another vector.
- A method that calculates the angle between vectors (or the cosine of the angle):
  the cosine of the angle between the vectors is equal to the scalar product of the
  vectors divided by the product of the modules (lengths) of the vectors
